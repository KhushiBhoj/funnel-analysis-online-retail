# Funnel Analysis – Online Retail Dataset (Single Year Analysis Report)

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to identify customer drop-offs, understand how value is generated across the business, and highlight opportunities to improve conversion and retention. Three complementary funnels were analyzed to capture different dimensions of customer behavior.

## Executive Summary: Top 3 Bottlenecks

1. **First-time to repeat purchase drop-off**
   - ~28% of customers do not return after their first purchase.
   - This represents the largest loss of potential customer lifetime value.

2. **Early-stage retention (Month 0 → Month 1)**
   - Across cohorts, only ~15–35% of customers return within the first month.
   - Most long-term churn occurs immediately after the first purchase.

3. **Under-optimized repeat customer monetization**
   - Revenue is driven more by repeat purchases and basket expansion than by customer growth.
   - There is additional upside in increasing order frequency and basket size among loyal customers.

## Funnel 1: Repeat Purchase Funnel  
**All Customers → Repeat Customers**

### Key Results
- Total Customers: 5,878  
- Repeat Customers: 4,255  
- Conversion to Repeat Purchase: 72.4%  
- Drop-off after First Purchase: 27.6%

### Findings
A strong majority of customers return for at least one additional purchase, indicating healthy baseline retention. However, more than one-quarter of customers churn after their first transaction, making early retention the most critical opportunity area.

### Business Impact
Reducing first-purchase churn would increase customer lifetime value and reduce dependence on acquisition-driven growth.

### Conversion Improvement Ideas
- Post-purchase nudges via email or SMS within 7–14 days  
- First-repeat incentives such as discounts, free shipping, or loyalty points  
- Personalized product recommendations based on first purchase behavior

## Funnel 2: Order-Level Value Funnel  
**Customers → Orders → Items Sold → Total Revenue**

### Key Results
- Customers: 5,878  
- Orders: 36,969  
- Items Sold: 779,425  
- Total Revenue: 17.37M  

### Findings
A relatively modest customer base generates a disproportionately high number of orders and items sold. This indicates that revenue growth is driven primarily by repeat purchasing behavior and basket expansion rather than customer acquisition alone.

### Business Impact
The business already benefits from strong repeat purchasing. Further gains can be achieved by increasing order frequency and average basket value.

### Conversion Improvement Ideas
- Cross-sell and bundle recommendations at checkout  
- Volume-based pricing and bulk discounts  
- Targeted promotions for high-value and repeat customers

## Funnel 3: Cohort Retention Funnel  
**Month 0 → Month 1 → Month 2 → …**

### Findings
- All cohorts start at 100% in Month 0, confirming correct cohort construction.
- A sharp drop-off occurs between Month 0 and Month 1 across all cohorts.
- Retention stabilizes after the initial decline, indicating a smaller but loyal customer base.
- Later cohorts show fewer observed months due to data availability.

### Business Impact
Early retention is the key inflection point. Customers who make it past the first repeat purchase are significantly more likely to remain active over time.

### Conversion Improvement Ideas
- Time-bound offers shortly after the first purchase  
- Improved onboarding and post-purchase experience  
- Loyalty programs that reward early repeat behavior

## Overall Conclusion

The funnel analysis indicates that the business’s primary challenge is not customer acquisition, but early-stage churn. The largest opportunity lies in converting first-time buyers into repeat customers and accelerating retention within the first month. By focusing on early engagement and optimizing repeat purchase incentives, the business can meaningfully increase customer lifetime value and drive sustainable revenue growth.
