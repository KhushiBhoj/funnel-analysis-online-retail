# 📊 Multi-Year Funnel Analysis Report

## Dataset
Online Retail (Multi-Year Transactional Data)

## Objective
Analyze funnel performance across multiple years to identify persistent bottlenecks, retention trends, and revenue patterns, and to determine whether observed issues are structural or year-specific.

---

## 1. Funnel Overview

The funnel tracks customer progression across the following stages:

- Order Initiation
- First Purchase
- Repeat Purchase
- Long-Term Retention

This multi-year view enables year-over-year comparison, cohort validation, and seasonality analysis.

---

## 2. Key Multi-Year Findings

### Bottleneck 1: First-to-Second Purchase Drop
- The largest drop-off consistently occurs between the first and second purchase.
- A majority of customers transact only once.
- This pattern remains stable across all analyzed years.

**Business Insight:**  
Customer acquisition is effective, but post-purchase engagement is insufficient to convert new customers into repeat buyers.

---

### Bottleneck 2: Retention Decay After Month 3
- Customer retention declines sharply within the first three months.
- Retention stabilizes afterward, but at a low baseline.
- Later cohorts show faster decay compared to earlier cohorts.

**Business Insight:**  
Short-term engagement exists, but long-term habit formation is weak.

---

### Bottleneck 3: Front-Loaded Revenue
- Most revenue is generated within the first 2–3 months of the customer lifecycle.
- Revenue contribution drops significantly beyond early lifecycle stages.
- Newer cohorts exhibit faster revenue decay.

**Business Insight:**  
Growth is driven more by new customer acquisition than by sustained customer value.

---

## 3. Year-over-Year Trends

### Improvements
- Initial conversion rates show modest improvement over time.
- Checkout completion has become more efficient in recent years.

### Declines
- Repeat purchase rates have decreased in newer cohorts.
- Long-term retention consistency has weakened.

### Stable Patterns
- Funnel shape remains largely unchanged year-over-year.
- Indicates structural funnel issues rather than isolated yearly effects.

## 4. Business Interpretation

| Observation | Implication |
|------------|------------|
High first-purchase volume | Marketing channels are effective |
Low repeat purchase rate | Retention strategy is underdeveloped |
Revenue concentrated early | Short customer lifetime value |
Consistent cohort decay | Structural funnel design issue |

---

## 5. Recommendations

### Improve Repeat Purchase Conversion
- Trigger post-purchase nudges within 7–14 days
- Offer limited-time discounts for second purchase
- Use personalized product recommendations

### Strengthen Early Retention
- Activate loyalty programs after first purchase
- Incentivize second purchase with free shipping or rewards
- Implement onboarding journeys for new customers

### Expand Revenue Over Time
- Introduce bundles or subscription-based offerings
- Run re-engagement campaigns for Month 2–3 inactive users

---

## 6. Limitations

- Analysis is limited to transactional data only
- No customer demographics or marketing attribution included
- External factors such as pricing or promotions not explicitly modeled

---

## 7. Next Steps

- Multi-year cohort segmentation
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling
- Churn prediction and targeted reactivation strategies

---

## 8. Final Note

This multi-year analysis highlights retention as the primary growth lever.  
Addressing early funnel drop-offs can significantly improve long-term revenue without increasing acquisition spend.

> This report is based on a multi-year transactional dataset. A deeper multi-year behavioral and CLV analysis will follow.
